    <p>
      Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Rachel and I currently live in Philadelphia, PA. I wasborn and raised in Fort Myers, FL and got my Bachelors in Hospitality Management from the University of Central Florida! I currently live with my boyfriend and my precious little
      nugget Charlie (pic of him on the right)! In my spare time I make resin and polymer clay
      earrings, I love to travel and go to the gym! I can’t wait to start my career in Web
      Development as it has always been a dream of mine for a while now!
